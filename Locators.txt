
Types of Locators in Selenium:- 


1. ClassName – A ClassName operator uses a class attribute to identify an object.

2.cssSelector – CSS is used to create style rules for webpages and can be used to identify any web element.

3.Id – Similar to class, we can also identify elements by using the ‘id’ attribute.

4.linkText – Text used in hyperlinks can also locate element

5.name – Name attribute can also identify an element

6.partialLinkText – Part of the text in the link can also identify an element

7.tagName – We can also use a tag to locate elements

8.xpath – Xpath is the language used to query the XML document. The same can uniquely identify the web element on any page.
